			{
				"question": "What is my chat user name?", 
			    "answer": "I am not quite sure what my username is since I don't go on my chat but I do know it runs through my email which is austinfigueroa335@yahoo.com so if you look me up you should find me. But then again I think it would be better to just email me."

            	"question": "In which time zone do you reside?",
            	"answer": "My time zone is the one and only eastern pacific."
            },
            {
            	"question": "Why Mobile Development?",
            	"answer": "The main reason why I am in this program, is because I was supposed to be in Game Development but ended up being short in the tuition fee. And then things didn't go my way so when I talked to my counselor she told me that Mobile Development would be the most similiar to Game Development and that is what brought me here to this Mobile Development Program."
            },
            {
            	"question": "How well am I with Javascript?",
            	"answer": "My comfortability depends on what I am doing I guess. Javascript came hard to me at one point but it was only because everything I was learning went in one ear and out the other and I didn't fully understand especially when I would ask questions and I wasn't on the same level as the person answering the questions and it became one cluster of information that didn't help me. Other than that Javascript is normal to me but sometimes I struggle."
            }, 
            {
            	"question": "How well am I with Titanium?", 
            	"answer": "I am more comfortable with Titanium than I am with Javascript. It's very much the easier way to program and it made me feel at ease once I started to program because I knew what I was doing right away. But again certain things I still need additional help so I can know I am doing it the way I want it to be displayed."
            },
            {
            	"question": "What is my favorite color?", 
            	"answer": "My favorite color would definately have to be red. With black coming very close to being my number one favorite."
            },
            {
            	"question": "What is my favorite food?", 
            	"answer": " My favorite food has to be Home Fries, I love the elegant taste it is bitter, sometimes sweet, salty, and just juicy. Everything about it can be altered and just made to the way you like it."
            },
            {
            	"question": "What are my hobbies?", 
            	"answer": "My hobbies include a select few such as playing video games, drawing pictures into my sketchbook, editing pictures on photoshop, writing stories and just watching as many anime shows that I can. "
            },
            {
            	"question": "What is my favorite movie?", 
            	"answer": "My favorite movie as of now would have to be Now You See Me, now this movie to me had it all suspense, a throw off (even though if you lead toward a main character to which you want to blame, most of the time it isn't that character.) And by far it just had me on my toes to where I loved every second of it and it made me want to make a story simliar to this kind of movie this was, but of course not the same sequence of what they did. Just my own twist to it to make it very surprisin, and in the end I did make the story but still it is in progress to where I have the main plot, but none of the details that are very important to which ties everything together."
            },
            {
            	"question": "What is my favorite TV show?", 
            	"answer": "So now we are at the end, and I have to tell you I saved this one for last. My favorite TV show of all time is One Piece, now this show is one of the oldest anime shows. As well as it is still running in Japan sadly to say after the 100th episode or so they discontinued the show in America. But it is okay I still enjoy the show in complete and I read the manga as well as watch the episodes. And thank you for joining me on this quest of getting to know me."
